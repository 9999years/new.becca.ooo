This is a list of scientific studies and opinion pieces / anecdotes from trans
people seeking to affirm several of my core beliefs — which are widely held
within the trans community:

* Trans people (should) own their bodies completely. With this right to bodily
  autonomy comes the right to choose when and how to transition, no matter if
  that means just dressing differently, HRT, or surgeries (although for a
  variety of reasons the majority of trans people don’t elect to get bottom
  surgery and many opt to not get any surgeries at all).

  * Many people don’t want to transition at all. **It’s not your business.**
    Don’t expect people to medically transition. And don’t ask people about
    their genitals.

* Trans people are happier when they’re allowed to transition, which manifests
  in improved mental health and increased stability. Similar effects are
  observed when parents and families support trans youth.

* Support trans people! Depending on your relationship to them, supporting a
  trans person can be simple or complex. See [support](#support) below for an
  incomplete list of things you can — and *should* do.

# Articles

[Hot Allostatic Load] by Porpentine. An article about being a trans woman and
being abused and maltreated. It “is about disposability from a trans feminine
perspective, through the lens of an artistic career. It’s about being human
trash.” “My first puberty was a nightmare—faced with the opportunity to make my
second one a healthy, healing experience, I was instead abused and broken.”

[“it’s infinitely more accurate to characterize a trans woman as a woman
pretending to be a man than it is to say she’s a man pretending to be a
woman”][opiumhug] & related discussion.

> Instead, cis women should be asking themselves what it would have been like if
> they had never been allowed to have their womanhood acknowledged. How would it
> have felt to grow up being told you were a boy, not allowed to deviate from
> male stereotypes (often with violent repercussions if you did), always viewed
> by other women as an icky boy or predatory male, exposed to the utter horror
> that is being a woman in male spaces where they think no women are around, and
> had testosterone distort your body irreparably only to have everyone around
> you use your anatomy and appearance to forever deny your womanhood and where
> your best possible outcome is to transition and live your life in abject
> poverty fighting loneliness and dysphoria and surrounded by people who think
> you’re a disgusting, subhuman monster who should be locked away or put down?

# Support

* Use their name and pronouns i.e. the name and pronouns they’ve told you to
  use for them. They are not preferred, they are mandatory. Exception: you are
  around people they are not out to, or they have asked you to use their old
  name around people they’re not out to.

    * When you mess up pronouns — which *happens*, we get it, everyone’s human
      — don’t make a big deal out of it. That’s the worst possible reaction.
      Correct yourself and move on. **Don’t even say sorry.** Move on as
      quickly as possible.

* Similarly, **normalize transness**.

    * Ask people for their pronouns when you meet them.

    * Similarly, don’t assume the gender of someone you haven’t met. Ask
      yourself how important it is for the anecdote you’d like to tell. Use
      [they/them] pronouns for strangers.

    * Often, trans people are forced to speak “on behalf of all trans people,”
      which is both uncomfortable and exhausting. If you see a trans person
      in that position — and know that your opinions are shared within the
      trans community — speak up to take some of the burden off them. Phrasing
      like “many trans people believe that...” or “from my understanding, the
      current consensus is that...” Make sure to defer to the trans person or
      people in the room, though. Make accepting trans people the default.

    * Disentangle gender and genitals within your vocabulary, and deeply
      consider what you want to generalize. Is this attribute shared by all
      men or people with penises? Chances are, if you’re not talking about
      sex, you don’t need to talk about genitals. [“If you’re grouping trans
      women with cis men then you’re probably already wrong.”][lesfeels]

* Don’t assume that trans people have dysphoria, a discomfort with their body.
  Focus on *gender euphoria*, the experience of delight with affirmative
  gender expression — rather than focusing on transness as an inherently
  miserable state of being. See [*Gender and Pleasure*].

* Help them change their name legally. Help them get hormones and a good
  doctor.

* **Financial** support: offering to foot the bill.

* **Logistic** support: helping them *find* a good doctor, helping them fill
  out name-change paperwork. Going shopping with them for affirming clothes.

* **Emotional** support:

   * Affirming confidently that you will love your trans friend / partner /
     child just the same and that you will support them wholeheartedly and
     with love through their whole experience.

   * Defending them against transphobia, implicit and overt.

   * Correcting others who mess up their pronouns. (Constantly defending
     yourself is hard! Leverage your privilege and pick up the slack!)

* Specifically for your non-binary friends:

    * Nonbinary people aren’t inherently “a mix of boy and girl” (although some
      people do feel like a plain mix; this doesn’t apply to them). Nonbinary
      people often exist outside of that spectrum entirely. Nonbinary people
      can express masculinity and femininity without being “more of a boy” or
      “more of a girl.” It’s critical that you learn to not attempt to view or
      categorize your non-binary friends within the lens of boy/girl entirely.

    * Don’t invalidate their genders; many non-binary people’s experience of
      gender varies from day to day (some of these people identify with terms
      like genderfluid). If they ask you to call them “she” or “he” for a day
      or a week, understand that this doesn’t make them any less non-binary —
      it makes them a genderfluid person using she/her pronouns, not a girl.

    * Don’t be weird about [neopronouns], which are pronouns other than
      he/she/they, like xe/xer or zi/zyr. They’re just pronouns. Take some time
      to learn them. It’s not a big deal. It costs $0.

* Don’t show us articles about trans people. It feels weird and patronizing,
  and we read them 6 months ago.

* Finally? **Leave us alone**. We’re tired of explaining ourselves. Don’t
  approach in public to say how supportive you are. Just... leave us be.
