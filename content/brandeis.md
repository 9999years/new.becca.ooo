[^1]: The BranVan situation is a bit complicated. Colloquially, “BranVan” refers to all the… Brandeis vans and buses. But strictly speaking, the BranVan is *only* the intra-campus shuttle and the evening Waltham shuttle. The situation is a bit unclear, even from the official Brandeis pages, but the daytime Waltham and Campus shuttles as well as all Boston shuttles are run by Joseph’s transportation — although there appears to be both a daytime campus shuttle (with Joseph’s) and a daytime campus BranVan.
[^2]: The light / large map *is* nicer but it’s also out of date, missing, among other things, the entire bio building. Beware!
