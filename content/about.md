i was born in 1998 and i live near boston — i attend brandeis university in
waltham — or sometimes washington dc, where my parents live. my pronouns are
[she/her][she], and my mbti is infp, probably

i like typography, fountain pens, sunglasses, computers, math, physics (which i
am terrible at), linguistics, modern art, film, and plants. within computers, i
like networks, clever data structures, unconventional rendering techniques,
compilers, static analysis, expressive syntax, unit testing, and cryptography

i make many different kinds of [art](/art) in my free time. i enjoy both coffee
and tea. i get a lot of nosebleeds and spend some of my free time gardening

maybe you’d be more interested in some of my [projects](/projects)?

now you know who i am, it’s important that you know [who i’m not](/not)
