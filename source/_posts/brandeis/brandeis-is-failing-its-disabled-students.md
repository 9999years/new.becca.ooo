*Note: This letter was originally published in [The Brandeis Hoot][hoot]. The
letter itself is a near-exact copy of an email I sent to interim student
accessibility services director Scott Kalicki, explaining why I was
uninterested in arranging a closed-door meeting where my concerns would
be Heard and then promptly and completely forgotten. Unfortunately, I suspect
that these complaints will already be familiar to disabled students at most
other US universities.*

Dear Brandeis Administration, Board of Trustees, Office of Budget and Financial
Planning, Student Accessibility Support and Counseling Center,

Thanks for asking me what I need as a disabled student to feel welcome and
succeed here. I need actual support --- in the form of professionals advocating
for me and my right to participate and belong in class and executive function
counseling. It’s immensely disappointing that neither our “[Student
Accessibility Support][sas]” nor our mental health services on campus are equipped to
help with executive functioning, so that’s out, which leaves us with advocacy.
You’ve heard me out asking for accommodations, and I’m grateful for that, but I
require more. I’m still not able to participate in my classes meaningfully; I
still need more to be done. And, too much of the time, your priority during our
conversations is to lead me back toward our disappointing and lackluster set of
“pre-prepared” accommodations, rather than actually making change to construct
an environment in which I can succeed.

Student Accessibility Support (SAS) has an obligation to provide me the
necessary support to succeed at Brandeis --- I’d love to receive that support.
But before I come to the table, I want some guarantee that SAS will be working
for me, and on my behalf, to provide me with accommodations --- not on behalf
of the administration and a board that sees Brandeis as an investment vehicle
more than an educational institution existing to make as little change as
possible. I’m sick of professors not knowing what my accommodations are because
nobody bothered to tell them and/or they didn’t bother to read their letters;
I’m sick of last-minute preparations for exams planned months in advance; I’m
sick of accommodations making my life harder; I’m sick of being left behind and
left out of the classes I’m going five figures into debt to participate in.

Are you going to work with me and my disabled peers to give us the learning
environment we were promised? Or are you going to work with the administration
to preserve university profits and avoid making changes for the disabled
“problem students” who are too mad to shut up and accept the scraps of
accommodations they’ve been offered by an unprofessional, understaffed, and
reactionary organization?

I want to know what you’re doing to change SAS. It’s falling short in a lot of
catastrophic and obvious ways, as [last year’s open letter to President Ron
Liebowitz][liebowitz-letter] showed. What are you doing to enact the
institutional-level change that needs to happen in order for disabled students
at Brandeis to be given the opportunities and access we’ve been promised? Our
time here is limited. My time here is limited. What have you been doing? What
will you do to fix the enormous failures Brandeis has demonstrated to its
disabled students before I graduate in a year? And if it’s “impossible” to fix
these failures, I want to know why. I want to know why it is acceptable for me
to be collateral damage, and I want to know why we’re okay, both personally and
institutionally, with disabled students falling through the cracks, with our
education being manufactured to fail and thoughtlessly thrown away.

Meeting with staff and administration --- deans, presidents, directors ---
takes time and energy from me --- precious, valuable resources that are
intensely limited due to my disability. I want some assurance that we can do
more than offer blank platitudes to each other. Spending my energy fighting for
accommodations makes it harder to attend classes and focus on my work here. I
don’t want explanations for why the system isn’t working; I want actions that
fix it. Here’s a tiny list of a few of the accommodations and changes I want,
off the top of my head. Make no mistake, this list is scattered and incoherent.
It’s scattered because that’s all I can muster. That’s all I can get out of my
brain today. In the words of Porpentine, [“I am too sick to write this
article.”][hot-allostatic-load] All I can squeeze out between sickness and
trauma and therapy and an unending stream of homework and essays and
obligations. It’s not a comprehensive and formal program of change to fully
reform Brandeis into a functional institution. It’s a set of specific failures
that I want addressed 30 years ago --- or, if Brandeis is aiming for second
best, --- today. These failures are overlapped and intertwined.

<span id=demands></span>
Here’s what I want:

1.  Material acknowledgment that I had to and have to work harder than my abled
    peers for the time at Brandeis when I didn’t have accommodations, and
    during the times when my accommodations have been inadequate or a majority
    of my energy has been spent attempting to navigate student accessibility
    (i.e. my entire college career so far). This could be in the form of extra
    credits awarded for each class (to reflect the additional effort and time I
    had to put in, compared to my peers) or in the form of a flat increase of
    the grades for each class (to reflect the limited time and resources I had
    to work with, particularly during exams, compared to my peers). I’m open to
    other options, but those two seem like the most obvious, reasonable,
    inexpensive, and non-disruptive.

2.  An alternative schedule that would allow me to focus intensely on one
    subject, because my disability prevents me from jumping around and managing
    four or five different schedules and four or five different professors who
    like to communicate in four or five different ways. A schedule that lets me
    dive deeply into the material and excel in a way that a scattershot choice
    of four or five different areas of knowledge prevents.

3.  Accommodations that focus on areas other than test-taking. Dramatically
    restructured lectures, with slides that present a coherent narrative for
    students to follow. Slides available online before the lectures.

4.  Courses restructured for chronically ill students who need to miss class on
    a nearly weekly basis or greater, allowing them to participate without
    excluding them or leaving them behind.

5.  A 30-student cap on every course, including introductory courses. This
    would mean splitting large courses into as many sections as we require and
    hiring additional faculty to teach those courses, focusing on
    underrepresented and marginalized academics.

6.  Failing to provide accessible and thorough course materials (including
    interactions through LATTE, timely responses to emails, assignment
    postings, syllabi, course texts, etc.) should be a tenure-revoking offense
    --- just like failing to meet any other job responsibilities would be.

7.  Sign language interpreters, large print, and braille materials available
    on request without needing a documented disability or any form of
    means-testing.

8.  Banning “no-electronics” policies that single out disabled students who use
    electronics as access tools and exclude disabled students who are not rich
    enough for a diagnosis. New policies which explicitly recognize that nearly
    all electronics, including cell phones, can be and often are access tools.

9.  Assignments to be posted to [LATTE][brandeis-latte] (the name of Brandeis'
    [Moodle][moodle] instance) in a timely fashion --- in general, for LATTE to
    actually be used promptly and correctly. Failing to put all the information
    about my assignments and courses in one place (e.g. with hidden syllabi,
    alternative course websites, critical announcements sent through emails and
    not otherwise posted to the course page) makes coursework unmanageable and
    leaves me (and in general, the most vulnerable students) behind.

10. I want better syllabi from all my professors, including all texts,
    assignment dates, and lecture material (at least down to the nearest week)
    to allow me to prepare for my courses. I want this information without
    having to email back and forth or meet individually with professors (as I
    did with every professor this semester).

11. I want an end to requirements for medical documentation to receive
    accommodations. If Google and JP Morgan can give me ADHD assessments poorly
    disguised as “personality quizzes” that they can then use to discriminate
    against me in the hiring process, we can figure out some way to make
    accommodations easier to access. (And yes, both of them did do that to me.
    I even kept screenshots.)

12. Increased student wages. My summer internships pay more than three times
    what I make at Brandeis. (An immense privilege!) Why doesn’t Brandeis value
    my talents? Increased pay would let me devote more of my time to keeping up
    with the classes I struggle with.

13. An independent council of disabled students and faculty members with a
    budget and the powers to enact changes to accommodations and university
    policy and to terminate professors with a history of misconduct.

14. A safety net for all students, but in particular new students. My
    first-year advisor didn’t meet with me or reply to my emails for an entire
    semester, leaving me to figure out everything on my own. That’s water under
    the bridge for me, but I don’t want it to happen to anyone else.

15. I want professors who want to teach. Professors who are hostile to students
    who ask questions or express interest should not be tolerated. It doesn’t
    serve students for the administration to force professors who only want to
    do research to teach courses. Similarly, I want Brandeis to hire professors
    based partially on their skill as educators, not exclusively on their
    expertise in their field. Given that the vast majority of courses are
    taught at the undergraduate level, it doesn’t make sense to prioritize
    incredibly specialized knowledge over the ability to share the basics
    within each field.

16. Mandatory accessibility training for every staff and faculty member on
    campus, so that I never get a look of surprise (or get scolded in front of
    a class) when I use an accommodation again. I should not need to explain my
    disability or my accommodations to professors who are capable of talking to
    SAS directly, because my time and energy is precious and limited. Having
    SAS “encourage that I self-advocate” is infuriating and counterproductive
    and has resulted in accommodations nearly falling through multiple times.

17. I want at least half of the SAS staff to be disabled, and for a dramatic
    increase in SAS staffing. Roughly [1 in 4 American adults live with a
    disability][cdc-disability]. Brandeis has [a population of
    5,800][brandeis-population] students, and let’s say that a single employee
    can effectively manage accommodations for about 50 students (probably
    stretching it). That works out to 29 SAS employees. Why do we not have that
    currently?

18. Similarly dramatic increases to [Brandeis Counseling Center (BCC)][bcc]
    staffing, reflecting the inability of mental health workers to adequately
    care for caseloads larger than 15 or 20 people at a time. An end to the
    policies that use group therapy to triage “low-priority” students. A
    dramatically increased budget. More than one trans therapist. Disabled
    therapists and an actually accessible building. An end to waiting lists for
    intake appointments in their entirety. Therapists specializing in learning
    disorders, ADHD, psychosis, OCD, PTSD and complex post-traumatic stress
    disorder (CPTSD), personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and
    [plurality][plural]. Therapists working in politically aware frameworks who
    are able to adequately address external stressors in a way that cognitive
    behavioral therapy (CBT) does not. Therapists who don’t reproduce trauma
    within their sessions, in particular with disabled students, trans students
    and students of color.

19. Admissions quotas for physically and mentally disabled students
    commensurate with the general population. Admissions quotas for students of
    color (and in particular for Black and Native students) and poor students
    commensurate with the general population. I want the unbalanced student
    population corrected in four years and the staff and faculty demographics
    corrected in six years.

20. Increased transportation options on campus as well as to Waltham and
    Boston/Cambridge, running at least twice as frequently. The ability to
    reserve space on a bus at any time (arbitrarily long or short) in advance
    of the bus’s journey with decreased barriers to entry and support for
    mobile devices in order to make driving a car no longer a necessity for
    students who live off campus.

21. Wheelchair accessibility for every floor of every building on campus ---
    including [Skyline][skyline], which, despite the tour guides' brags that
    it's [the most accessible building on campus,][skyline-a11y] has heavy,
    difficult-to-open, manual interior doors. I want tour guides to announce
    every building that isn’t wheelchair accessible when showing the campus to
    prospective students. And I want real accessibility, not just “well
    technically you can get to [Goldsmith][goldsmith] 300 by entering [Volen][volen] across the quad,
    going down a long hallway, taking an elevator, crossing the skybridge, and
    passing through several heavy and non-automatic (i.e. not wheelchair
    accessible) doors”-style accessibility. I want the wheelchair-accessible
    routes through campus to be direct and convenient, not coiled through back
    hallways like they were designed by Wile E. Coyote.

I’m tired of the avoidant non-responses I’ve gotten from SAS in the past year,
and I’m tired of wasting my breath in closed-door meetings. I hope we can make
some broader changes to allow me to succeed here, as well as my disabled peers
and future students, many of whom are not as eloquent or as aware of their poor
treatment as I am.

The last time I met with SAS, I was told that “there’s not a brick that doesn’t
move” when it comes to accessibility. Here are some bricks. Let’s get moving.
