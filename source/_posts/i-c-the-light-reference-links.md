## Reference Links

### Distance Estimation / Ray Marching

[The Science of Fractal Images, Heinz-Otto Peitgen and Dietmar Saupe, eds.
(1988)][28] <br>
Fractal rendering algorithms.


[Ray Tracing Deterministic 3-D Fractals by John C. Hart et. al (1989)][1] <br>
The first paper on distance-estimating 3d fractals as a ray-marching
technique!

[Distance Estimated 3D Fractals][2] <br>
Distance-estimated 3D fractals. This is what I really want to do, and the
source that lead me to this.

[Demoscene Presentation on Ray Marching][3] <br>
“Don’t define the surface first and then compute the distance field, but
directly code a distance field and a surface will emerge.” <br>
Unfortunately, a lot of the links in this presentation are dead.

[Ray march shaders on Stack Exchange][4] <br>
A nice overview of what the algorithm is with unfortunately and
understandably little on the specifics of applying it.

[Sample functions for various primitive objects in a ShaderToy][5] <br>
Made by Iñigo Quilez, who seems to be very prominent in this scene. <br>
[More information here on his website.][6] <br>
Also shows how to calculate binary intersections (unions, subtractions,
and intersections) of objects, repeat/rotate/translate/scale objects,
displace and blend objects, and more. This is a gold mine.

[Terrain Ray Marching][7] <br>
Also by Iñigo Quilez.

[Ray marching soft shadows][8] <br>
Thanks Iñigo Quilez.

[Ray marching with THREE.js][9] <br>
Surprisingly achievable and smooth in Javascript, although complexity
suffers.

[Distance estimation of Mandlebrot and Julia sets][10]

### Open Source Ray Tracers And Guides

[Smallpt, a raytracer written in 99 lines of C++][11]

[Introduction to Ray Tracing: a Simple Method for Creating 3D Images][12] <br>
A more conceptual overview of the topic.

[Fuzzy Photon — How to write a Raytracer][13] <br>
Gets into details with specific problems and code examples.

[UCI RayTracing Tutorial][14] <br>
Contains more information on depth of field, isosurfaces (blobs), and auto
exposure. <br>

[Luminosity ray tracer written in Haskell][15] <br>
A lot of more mathematical language here, as should be expected from a
Haskell project.

[Purple Alien Planet Raytracer written in C][16] <br>
An open-source implementation containing lots of math and explanations for
the underlying algorithms.

[The Rendering Equation][17] <br>
The rendering equation describes the total amount of light emitted from a
point x along a particular viewing direction, given a function for
incoming light and a BRDF.

[SDL Skeleton capable of drawing pixels to the screen][18] <br>
This may have saved me effort in writing boilerplate, although I had already
done most of this earlier. It’s definitely good to have another reference,
though.

### Perlin Noise

[Understanding Perlin Noise][19] <br>
Perlin noise for procedural textures, reads a lot on 2d noise (because of
simplicity to explain and diagram) but still very digestible. A lot like the
Eevee link.

[Improved Noise reference implementation][20] <br>
A compact (3062-byte) Java implementation of Perlin noise, by Perlin himself.
Not dynamic or 4-dimensional, and filled with many weird hacks, but a good
starting point.

[Improving Perlin Noise by Ken Perlin][21]

[Perlin Noise by Eevee][22]

[Formulas for picking a random point on the surface of a sphere][23]

[Perlin noise derivatives by Iñigo Quilez][24]
