# about

<img title="A dated selfie of me in San Fransisco, smiling. My hair is bleached blond
and has just been cut into a rough bob; it's a little bit wavy but not curly.
My eyes are nearly shut when I smile. I am wearing a black backpack and a black
shirt, although that's not a commonplace occurance for me." class="aside"

sometimes i write code but more commonly i am annoying.
my pronouns are [she/her][she].

i believe in source code that's not just plain text, as well as in hiring dogs.

it’s also important that you know [who i’m not](/not)

[she]: http://my.pronoun.is/she/her
